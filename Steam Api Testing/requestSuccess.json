The ultimate hybrid of performance and passion.\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/zy4FETH.jpg[/img]\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[code][b]The open road is full of stories. How will you tell yours?

Plus, you never know when the opportunity could arise to transport a crate or two. When adventure calls, the Nexus' spacious cargo capacity answers.\r\n    [*][h2]ATTACH AND INTEGRATE[/h2]\r\nCustom modules can be easily created and connected to the Nexus' cargo bay. You need something? Whatever you want can be added with ease, so long as you can create a module for it.\r\n    [*][h2]MULTIPLAYER FRIENDLY[/h2]\r\nAs with any other SM Industries creation, the Nexus is multiplayer friendly, you won't need to worry about lag when playing with friends. You'll be able to bring a couple of Nexuses into the game before lag becomes an issue.\r\n[/list]\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[code][h1][u]INSTRUCTIONS[/u][/h1]\r\n[olist]\r\n    [*]Sit down in the driver seat.\r\n    [*]Wait for SM OS to start up.\r\n    [*]Switch to the needed gear using the up/down arrows.\r\n[/olist]\r\n\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[code][h1][u]REPORTING BUGS[/u][/h1]\r\n\r\nYou can do this by opening a discussion on this page and setting the title to a short description of the bug, then describing the bug in detail in the actual description field.\r\n\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n[code][h1][u]DO NOT REUPLOAD WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION FROM THE CREATOR(S)!![/u][/h1][/code]\r\n\r\n[code][h1][u]CREDITS[/u][/h1]\r\nSpecial Thanks to:\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Geekness - For the touchscreen map.\r\n    [*]jecki1379 - For the touchscreen radio.\r\n[/list]\r\nThis creation was inspired by the Origin g12 series from Star Citizen.\r\n[/code]\r\n",
